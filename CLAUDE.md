# AI GTM Skills for Claude Code

This repo contains 16 ready-to-use AI agent skills for go-to-market and revenue leadership. Skills are installed to `~/.claude/skills/` by the bootstrap script.

**First week?** Start with five. `meeting-prep`, `prospect-research`, `deal-strategy`, `pipeline-health`, `post-call-summary`. They cover the full revenue motion and are the same five the Session 5 demos walk through. Once those feel automatic, the [Power Prompting 201](https://aigtmschool2026q2.vercel.app/power-prompting-201) reference covers the compounding moves (chaining, custom Layer 1 patterns, anti-hallucination constraints, JSON output, when *not* to use a skill).

## First-Time Setup. Personal Profile

**If `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` does not exist, you MUST run the onboarding flow below before doing anything else.** Do not skip this. Do not summarize the skills. Do not answer other questions first. The skills work significantly better when Claude has context about who the user is.

### Onboarding Flow

Walk the user through these questions conversationally. Be warm and direct, this is a colleague setting up their workspace, not a customer filling out a form.

**Step 1. Who are you?**
- What's your name?
- What's your title and company?
- One sentence. what do you do day-to-day?

**Step 2. What do you sell?**
- What does your company sell? (product/service, one sentence)
- Who buys it? (target buyer title and company type)
- What's your average deal size and sales cycle length? (rough is fine)

**Step 3. Who's your ICP?**
- What industry or vertical do your best customers come from?
- What company size (employees or revenue) is your sweet spot?
- What signals tell you a company is a good fit? (tech stack, funding stage, hiring patterns, etc.)

**Step 4. Who do you compete with?**
- Name your top 3-5 competitors.
- In one sentence each, how do you position against them?

**Step 5. What tools do you use?**
- CRM? (Salesforce, HubSpot, Clarify, etc.)
- Outreach platform? (Outreach, Salesloft, lemlist, Reply.io, etc.)
- Any other tools you use daily?

### After the conversation.

Generate a `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file using the Write tool with the following structure. Fill it in based on their answers. Use their natural language, don't over-formalize it.
